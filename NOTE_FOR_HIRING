I created automated tests that cover the functionality of the section. Testing individual component styles should be handled by unit tests, not by end-to-end (E2E) tests.

I am not using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern because I believe it would add unnecessary complexity to a simple project. I am in favor of following good coding practices and reusing code, but I think this can be achieved without implementing this specific pattern.

I am not using TypeScript for the same reason. I also donâ€™t consider it particularly valuable in test automation projects, since test execution is already controlled by QA, and it is not expected to encounter unhandled errors.

I would consider creating tests following the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach. However, at this stage, and due to the short scope of the project, I decided not to introduce that additional complexity.
